# Amazon-Web-Scraper-Emailer
Using Python, automated the collection of Amazon data to email potential discounts to users daily.

This specific program checks daily if the price of this t-shirt goes below $15. The daily prices are added to a csv file locally. 

If the price goes below $15 on a certain day, then the program will automatically email the end user and remind them that the item has gone on sale!
